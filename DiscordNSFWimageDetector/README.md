# Discord NSFW image detector ([Unity](https://top.gg/bot/811668584559935488))
A Discord bot that detects NSFW images sent in channels, unless the channel is an NSFW channel, devpost [link](https://devpost.com/software/unity-aeqlpv).
Currently in about 60 servers (If it grows to more than 100 servers, I'm screwed) - Discord makes you do dumb KYC verification stuff.
